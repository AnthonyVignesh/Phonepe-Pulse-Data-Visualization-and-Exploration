# Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization
-- PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration: A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly


**PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization Project**

*Developed a user-friendly tool for visualizing and exploring PhonePe Pulse data using Streamlit and Plotly.*

**Data Retrieval:**
- Fetched PhonePe Pulse data from PhonePe's Repo via Git Clone.
- Transformed JSON data to Pandas DataFrames.
- Converted data to CSV format and downloaded to the local environment.

**SQL Integration:**
- Created eight tables in SQL.
- Transferred the data to SQL tables using Python with PostgreSQL connection.

**Streamlit Interface:**
- Utilized Streamlit for the front-end interface.
- Implemented dynamic visualizations using Plotly, including Choropleth maps.
- Enabled user interaction to select options, triggering back-end queries to fetch and process data from SQL.
- Presented visual representations in the Streamlit interface based on user selections.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Presented visual insights in real-time within the Streamlit interface.
   - Utilized Choropleth maps and other Plotly visualizations for effective data representation.

*This project seamlessly integrates data retrieval, transformation, storage in SQL, and dynamic visualization in Streamlit to offer a comprehensive tool for exploring PhonePe Pulse data.*
